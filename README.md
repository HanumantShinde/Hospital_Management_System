🏥 Hospital Management System (HMS)

A full-stack Hospital Management System built with **Spring Boot 3**, **Angular 19**, and **MySQL**. Features role-based access control with three distinct user roles — Admin, Doctor, and Patient — each with their own secured dashboard and functionality.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Security
* Stateless JWT authentication — token carries email and role, no server-side sessions
* BCrypt password encryption — plain text passwords never stored in database
* Role-based access control enforced at both API level (Spring Security) and UI level (Angular Guards)
* JWT filter intercepts every request before it reaches any controller
* Public registration endpoint force-sets role to PATIENT — no user can self-assign ADMIN or DOCTOR role

### 👨‍💼 Admin Dashboard
* View total doctors and patients with live count cards
* Add new doctors and patients directly from dashboard
* Delete doctors and patients with confirmation dialog
* Instant UI update on delete — no page refresh needed

### 👨‍⚕️ Doctor Dashboard
* View all assigned appointments with color-coded status badges
* Update appointment status (PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED → CANCELLED)
* Add clinical notes to appointments
* Edit own profile — specialization, experience, phone

### 🧑‍⚕️ Patient Dashboard
* Self-register and login independently
* Browse available doctors with specialization details
* Book appointments with date, time, and symptom notes
* View own appointment history with real-time status updates
* Edit own profile — age, blood group, phone, address

## 🏗️ Architecture
Angular Frontend (port 4200)
↓
HTTP Request + JWT Token in Authorization header
↓
JwtAuthFilter — validates token, extracts email + role, stores in SecurityContext
↓
SecurityConfig — checks if role is allowed to access this URL
↓
Controller Layer — receives request, calls service
↓
Service Layer — business logic (BCrypt, role assignment, identity from SecurityContext)
↓
Repository Layer — Spring Data JPA queries to MySQL
↓
MySQL Database
↓
Response flows back up through Service → DTO (strips sensitive fields) → Controller → Angular

Test Configuration

Uses H2 in-memory database for repository tests
Security filters are disabled in controller tests using @AutoConfigureMockMvc(addFilters = false)
Mockito is used for mocking dependencies


🔐 Authentication Flow
text1. POST /api/auth/login  →  { email, password }
2. BCrypt validates password against stored hash
3. JWT token generated with email + role embedded inside
4. Token returned to Angular — saved in localStorage
5. Every subsequent request:
   Angular Interceptor attaches → Authorization: Bearer <token>
   JwtAuthFilter validates token → extracts email + role
   SecurityConfig checks role permission for URL
   Controller retrieves identity from SecurityContext

🛡️ Security Design Decisions
Why BCrypt? Plain text passwords never stored — even if database is compromised, passwords cannot be reversed from hashes.
Why JWT stateless? Server stores no session data — every request is self-contained with identity proof inside the token. Scales horizontally without shared session storage.
Why role embedded in token? Eliminates database lookup on every request to check the user's role — filter extracts it directly from the token in memory.
Why SecurityContext for identity? Controllers never trust client-supplied identity — they extract who the logged-in user is from the verified token via SecurityContext. A patient cannot claim to be a different patient by changing a request parameter.
Why DTOs? Raw JPA entities contain BCrypt password hashes — DTOs strip sensitive fields before any data leaves the backend, regardless of which endpoint is called.
